                "The success of machine learning typically relies on selecting an appropriate ML approach that suits both the data and the question being answered. For example, the topic modelling that we did in C1 involved the assumption that there were latent topics in the data that could be analysed by fitting a topic model to the data. If this assumption was true, if the data was appropriately structured, and if we selected a reasonable value for 'k' (number of topics), then we were able to obtain helpful topics that described that underlying data. However, if any of these conditions were not met, then the quality of the results deteriorated. Thus, when using ML, it is important to know your data, understand what question/s you are trying to address, know which ML models might be appropriate, and be willing to experiment with different combinations of models and parameters in order to obtain reliable results.\n",
