    "- COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus, which has already propagated to 102 countries in just 3 months.\n",

    "- Data shows, as expected, the sigmoid tendency of the propagation of the virus. In China, it seems the virus is no longer in exponential phase and is slowly stabilizing.\n",
    "- Panic in current population might be due to the effects of media and the fact that information was attempted to be hidden from the public (remember the Spanish flu)\n",
    "- This panic in population can also be an effect of **negative bias** where people tend to put more weight on the occurence of negative events, even if the chance of those negative events happening is very low.\n",
    "- These insights should not ignore the severity of the virus. Higiene measures, quarantines, traveling control and a healthy diet are advised to slowdown the virus."
