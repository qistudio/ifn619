    "Experiment with this principle by using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) to give you suggestions for python code to do an analysis task (e.g. Ideation and augmentation). Below is a trivial example, but you can experiment with more complex examples. Run the generated code in your notebook to check if ChatGPT provided you with a helpful response (e.g. human evaluation).\n",

    "3 common mistakes in UA1 to avoid in UA2:\n",
    "1. **Not reading, understanding, and doing the assignment instructions.** For example:\n",
    "    - PART A - \"Success in this part will address criteria 3 (Basic techniques) & 4 (Verification) on the rubric, and when completed fully together with a reasonable attempt of Part B will guarantee you a minimum of a 4 for the assignment. For criteria 4, you will need to provide evidence during your tutorial and/or drop-in sessions of your understanding of how you completed Part A\"\n",
    "    - PART B - \"Success in this part will address criteria 1 (Narrative) & 2 (Investigation and Justification) on the rubric, and is essential to be completed well to get a 7 for the assignment. In this part, you will apply a full data analytics cycle to a given scenario with provided data. However, you will choose the questions that you address, the way that you approach the analysis, and the kind of visualisation. You will also be required to effectively tell the story (the narrative) how your analysis leads from questions to insights, together with the reasoning behind your decisions. Also included in an effective narrative is avoiding simple assumptions and taking an ethical nuanced approach to the data.\"\n",
    "    - \"IMPORTANT: You will NOT be assessed on the quality of your code, but you WILL be assessed on the decisions you make and why you used the code that you did.  You will be marked on (a) HOW you undertake the task todgether; with (b) detail of WHY you made various decisions involved in the tasks\"\n",
    "    - \"You should familiarise yourself with the [Advance Queensland Program and Grants](https://advance.qld.gov.au) to understand the context for the data.\"\n",
    "    - \"your task is to analyse the publicly available data on the distribution of the funds over time. You are looking for patterns that may support the \"good news\" story, or which may be a cause for concern.\"\n",
    "    - \"the insights that you draw should take into account contextual factors. You should avoid simplistic assumptions\"\n",
    "2. **Not paying attention to critical tasks.** For example:\n",
    "    - \"Identify high quality questions that when answered may be helpful in addressing the scenario above\"\n",
    "    - \"you must document your thinking and approach throughout the notebook using the Markdown cells\"\n",
    "    - \"you will apply a full data analytics cycle to a given scenario with provided data. However, you will choose the questions that you address, the way that you approach the analysis, and the kind of visualisation\"\n",
    "3. **Not reading and understanding the rubric, nor ensuring that your work is appropriate evidence.** For example:\n",
    "    - Complete part A with verification to address criteria 3 & 4\n",
    "    - To address criteria 2, complete all stages of the data analytics cycle AND effectively justify your analysis - \"detail of *WHY* you made various decisions\"\n",
    "    - To address criteria 1, effective and ethical data analytics narrative - \"high quality questions\", \"detailed insights\", HOW, WHY, WHERE (NOT WHAT!)\n"
