    "The literature of machine learning is generally surounded by two types of machine learning algorithms: neural networks and support vector machines. Support vector machines (SVMs) classify data using an optimization function: the idea is to compute the support vectors (the bourdaries) of the data and then find a hyperplane that can separate it. \n",

    "In Python, you can implement a SVM very quickly using all the knowledge of machine learninig that you learned so far. For the curious students, you can explore this technique for image classification, in the following book:\n",
