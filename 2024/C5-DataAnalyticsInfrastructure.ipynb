    "Throughout this unit, you have been running your notebooks on data analytics infrastructure provided by QUT eResearch. In technology focused businesses that develop new tech solutions (or large business with business units that do this), the team that provides data analytics infrastructure is often referred to as [DevOps (development operations)](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/#:~:text=DevOps%20is%20the%20combination%20of,development%20and%20infrastructure%20management%20processes.). In other businesses, this infrastructure might be provided as a service (e.g. [Google Colab](https://colab.google) or [Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws)).\n",

    "\n",
    "Many DevOps infrastructure solutions are provided using Container technologies like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). These are virtualisation technologies that are inspired by the efficiencies realised by the [shipping container](https://theconversation.com/global-shortage-of-shipping-containers-highlights-their-importance-in-getting-goods-to-amazon-warehouses-store-shelves-and-your-door-in-time-for-christmas-168233) in 1956 (from USD$5.86 per ton to USD$0.16 per ton).\n",
